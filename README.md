# Project Description
Some of the very worst designed websites youâ€™ll come across are for banking, credit card payment, 
HR portals, and other non-optional websites for certain classes of customers or workers. Self-selected teams of 3 
students will redesign a website assigned in class. Additionally, you will add a compelling log in page, 
as if this were an on-line course for sale. Your redesigned should employ sound principles of 
human-computer interaction, user experience, and emotional design.

# Project Goals
- Conduct a task analysis for creating a user-centered design
- Select 3 page of the website to redo. Two content pages and one process page. 
  The process page should be a html form page. Like a sign up page or a purchase page. 
  One content page should be the home page.
- Apply design principles including color/material, typography, accessible media, and grid-based design.
- Execute a progressively enhanced, touch-friendly, mobile-first responsive design focused on system users and tasks.
- Write informative text content; catch error conditions and guide users accordingly.
- Experiment with design and interaction patterns for pleasing user experience.
- Engage in agile, iterative web design and development within a team-based work-flow on GitHub, via pull requests and code reviews.
